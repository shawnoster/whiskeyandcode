I gave my [Build 2012](http://www.buildwindows.com/) talk this week and it was all around WP8 XAML app development showing off some of cool new features in the XAML platform that you can incorporate into your apps.

A huge thanks to all the people that showed up, gave feedback and asked questions! I know a few people asked me questions via e-mail & twitter and if I missed your question apologies, I'll be more than happy to answer any remaining ones now that things have calmed down a little. I wasn't able to go into deep detail on everything I wanted to so if there was something you want to see more of just drop me a comment.

The talk, like all the other great Build talks, was recorded and is [available to watch](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/2-021) directly from channel9 or you can download it and watch it offline.&nbsp; I've also posted the source for my demo and the deck itself.&nbsp; Some parts of the source may look a little different from the demo and that's because I cleaned it up and streamlined it some, I have a hard time sometimes leaving code as is, especially if I see a way to make it better.
