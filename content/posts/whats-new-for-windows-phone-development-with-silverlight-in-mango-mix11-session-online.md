My talk from MIX11 has made its way online and for those that couldn't attend (or those that were still recovering from the great attendee party and discovered that 9am is way too early to attempt to move) a video of my session is online over only channel9 available for streaming or downloading.

Also for your direct viewing pleasure here it is embedded.

For anyone that watches it and has questions, or people in the audience that didn't get a chance to ask one feel free to drop me a line in the comments and I'll do the best I can to find you the answers.

Also because not everyone had time to fill out their speaker evals if there is a type of content or way you'd like to see this content delivered in the future I'd love to hear your feedback in general. More or less code? More technical details, would you prefer to see flashy demos that rock but require a lot of code or more simple demos that clearly show the feature?

MIX is for **you** so anything we can do to help improve content is greatly appreciated.
