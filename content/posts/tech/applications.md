# Applications

## The Basics

* 1Password (_because you have no idea what your passwords are any more_)
* Dropbox (because that's where all my data is)

## Dev

* Visual Studio Code - Insiders (_because it's awesome and who doesn't need a little more frustration in their day running a beta?_)
* Sublime 3 (_eats large files for 2nd breakfast_) Needs an activation code for dev builds, it's in 1Password
* Slack (_gotta get that work done_)
* Chrome (_for the sites that just gave up_)
* Telegram (_best IM ever, why doesn't everyone use it?_)
* Wox (_muscle memory has set in, just install it so you don't leave your Alt-Spacebar hanging_)
* Everything (_rarely use it but Wox is grumpy without it and comes in handy now and then_)
* Windows Terminal (_Microsoft nailed the terminal_)
* Ubuntu (_you can have the best of both worlds_)
* HoneyView (_only looks like a desktop app from the mid-90s a little_)
* Node (_you're going to need it eventually, might as well get it over with_)
* Git (_not Github Desktop yet, the version it comes with confuses me so keep it easy starting stand-alone_)
* Github Desktop (_because I'm lazy and don't believe anyone can really make sense of the standard diff spew_)
