### [x] create a new file everyday

- no obvious git action, I sort of gave up and fell back to a weirder idea
- I'll probably go back and make sure but
- I really like the idea of an Azure Function creating a new file in git
- oh snap, that's just a pipeline, which means I was looking in the wrong place on git
- Oh well, next time. I still might try the function, might have too...
- There's a way to schedule an action
- helpful links
  - https://jasonet.co/posts/scheduled-actions/
- date format `date +%Y-%m-%d`
