## Misc

### Extensions

- [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) - surprisingly helpful extension that displays CSV columns in unique colors, very helpful for spotting misplaced delimiters.
- [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - overclocked git support with tons of sauce. It's so big and I use it so little that I've been primed to uninstall it the second it crashes or even seems to slow vscode down but damn if it hasn't been rock solid. Give it a spin, even if like me you mostly keep your gitting on the CL.

### Color Themes

I cycle color themes based on what I'm doing; deep coding is all about a muted, complementary palette that doesn't distract while maintenance and review tend to be more colorful with more prominent comments to make parsing the code easier.

I use dark themes except when copy/pasting snippets via e-mail where I use the stock Light+ theme.
