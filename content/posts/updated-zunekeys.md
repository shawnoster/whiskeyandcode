Awhile back I wrote a wee [little Delphi application](/posts/zunekeys-global-hotkey-support-for-zune) to mimic WinAmp's Global Hotkeys in the Zune software, call [ZuneKeys](/downloads/ZuneKeys.zip). With the new Zune software out I had to update ZuneKeys to work with it so if you're one of the three people that actually like global hotkeys go ahead and grab the new version from the above links.

For nerds that care I had to change the window class I was searching for from "WMPlayerAppZune" to "UIX Render Window". Long Zheng over on istartedsomething has some more interesting bits about this [whole "UIX" business](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071116/microsoft-iris-uix-framework-zune/).
