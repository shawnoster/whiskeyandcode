I'm being lazy and just posting a link because I think this feature is that cool:

[SubSonic: Migrate Me](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/03/subsonic-migrate-me/)

If you've used Rails you'll know why this is so cool and if you haven't then think "A really cool way to version your database schema and all it's changes and it's default data." The Rails kids shouldn't have all the fun. Read the article, Rob Conery will explain it much better than I ever could.

Plus, he's been known to use phrases like "[The Tits](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/09/26/subsonic-whats-happening-now/)" when describing software features and you just don't see quality writing like that just anywhere.
