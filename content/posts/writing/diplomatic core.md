Like Jake the dog liked to say, it all boiled down to fuck, kill, or eat.

The first time you see a monster walking calmly towards you munching on what looks exactly like a bag of deep-fried infact heads is a bit of a shock. To put it mildly. That's where the Contract came into play.

What is food for one culture can look exactly like the cheried offspring of another. Imagine meeting a specics of highly intleggent cows while eating a steak?

Of course the cultures never imagined that a healthy snack of a broccolli was considered a mass murder to another specics. When humans first entered the scene another culture spent cycles trying to free the enslaved machine mines that were enslaved and forced to perform menial tasks such as toasting bread. It took considerable diplomatic processing to assure the Tezzics that coffee machines weren't an enslaved dominate race under thrall to their meat pets.

Humans were in fact considered both meat and species.

It's for this very reason that sweeper crews were a broad mix of cultures. 

The fear of a machine intelligence rising to take over the universe, or of super-power AIs pulling the universes puppet strings out of either a long processing con, altrusitic drive or simple bordem. To exist in the broader galactic culture was to need a mix of all of those inside of it. While most organic minds couldn't possible match the processing power of a meta-distrubted AI (or, to be honest, even a common space mushroom) they were still an essential part of the whole.

Fuck wasn't as clear cut as your biology tells you. Quite a few cultures lacked any concept of sexual drive, their reproduction and specics propogation following discinctly different lines. Even amoung the fuck races many never broken from their seasonal cycles and only became horny at certain times. Still others had shifted themselves towards a more asyexual baseline that removed sexual drive after considering it a blocker to not killing each other.

That still left a lot of cultures though that did like to fuck for recreaction and the pure pleasure of it, which obviously led to a lot of experimenting with how to fuck each other. It was easier when the differences between cultures was obvious, the 9 foot furred Gnarlack with it's massive claws and a thing that looked like a massive two-headed snack right where a nice cock would be. It was actually a vertigal tail that proved useful enough to keep around. A Gnars fine-grained motor control and ability to semi-change it's shape and thickness made it an instant hit with those that enjoyed being filled and with the right drugs a Gnars usual erogenious zones could be re-mapped to their tail.

Care had to be taken to not accidently turn one memeber into another's sex slave. There was a spat of incidents where the cat-like members of the Draounis were befriending fresh bipeds under the guise of guides and personal assistants, being sure to let them it was okay if the biped felt the urge to pet them like a house cat. Belly rubs, tail tugs, ear scratches... there were all deeply sexual and in their culture basically made them dirty, slutty cockwhores and drug addicts, because part of their fuck was a chemical hold that kept them returning. On their world it would last until the young were dead or safe, then it would fade. With humans it just increased. An adventure because an addication.

Synergistic cultures beneifted each other by giving an outside perspective and something to compare against. One particually fun area is how language became more precies, especially dirty talk. In a single culture the need to have exact definiations for even the most filthy of sexual phrases rarely came up since most bipeds mated within a similiar social group, with shared cultural references. The same porn, the same environment, common global touch points, shared media. So when someone whispers to their contorted and exposed partner that they're a filthry little slut there's at least a general ballpark idea of what they mean and how they mean it in that moment.

When cultures with no common touch points except a biological alignment that allows them to enjoy fucking each other without aid start fucking and talking dirty suddenly there's a very real need to be really clear what that phrase implies. There are stories of a hauler blowing off steam with two Drizos that were looking for a week-long bender, the three of them fucking like it was a race to see how much weird shit they could do in 8 reps. Until he was getting a blowjob sandwich and called them both his cum-obsessed bitches in heat. You see, his last fuck, a solar adapted diplomate for a highly structured roleplay, had really been into that sort of thing and he'd developed a taste. Seems they didn't the memo that he was only adding some spice to his flow and they heard the deepest, worst, and most vile phrase in their enire culture. So they safeworded and in their exit fuguge turned him into 1" cubes.

So, dity talk went from whatever weird shit popped into someones mind to a vulnerable and honest contract negotation. To call someone a fuckpet meant you were asking for a very specific thing, and for them to lable themselves as such was to agree with intent vs. passive. It shifted the intensity of filthy talk into the thrill of sharing something so personal with someone you just met. Rape was considered the violation of that contract. Renegotation was an encourged option, just as accepting any denails. 

He renegoatied three more times that night, each time she happily accepted out of curiousity on where this was going and just what about the cunt she'd wokenup with every day was driving this well-fucked hauler to continue to pick fucking her over one of his very rew sleep cycles that wasn't in his cab. He wanted to use her so badly she could see him straining to stay in balance, she could hear how he WANTED her so badly that he feared she'd say no to another contract. She could smell the animal in him demanding he take her now, now, now, and found herself admiring his control over that beast.

Most species have a handful of 100% synergistic matches. This means they look fairly similiar, they have bio-patterns that map along similiar constructs, they can fuck each other without aids (and will enjoy it), they share enough tastebuds to enjoy similiar meals, etc. They all fuck, it's what bios do. What makes the Human-Cat connection unique(ish) and borderline out of contract is that, because their meat ancestors mating was so intense and rough, and the only way to tell between a long term thinking mate and a short one was those that took the time to clam them via motions very much like petting a cat, that very act because their foreplay. Did I say rough? Not only was it a physical contest to measure health, it was also meant to slightly injure the female in order to make her stay put. So, very rough fucking with a very wicked looking cock. It's since become a more refined and collabrotive prick but back then it could get so intense their body started producing pure meth to help. It's not really meth but it feels fucking amazing, it makes everything feel better, you feel safe and so submissive, it keeps you horny to make sure you're pregnant, and it keeps you chemically drawn and almost dependent upon that person to continue triggering the drug, until you have a kid or they become unsuitable.

That's well and good but when a human, with an instictual habit of casually petting cats, turns that on what looks to them a hot cat-pet cosplay that's really into but is still hot, then they do it more, not knowing that act is so intimate and rare and hard to trigger without her being utterly aroused, which dumps more into their system. It's fun for a weekend but is highly additive for certain cats. The submissive cycle isn't the issue, it's that after a certain point they lose all desire to ever be anything else. They become drug addicated fuckpets that are utterly devoted and are aware of what's going on and proudly accept it.

In Drizo culture it's highly taboo and considered plain weird because there is a time when they're not yet locked in. When they walk away and the feelings will clear in a few hours. The day before the dependency sets in they feel very sharp, very focused, allowing a mature and consentual decision to proceed. This is how they fuck dirty. See how close to that line they can get. The real kinky cross that line with the trust their partner will free them. This is the slutiness of a Drizo in a long term pet relationship. They had a chance to leave, they didn't. 

There is also the Drizo chemical safeword. If pushed beyond their limits the bond snaps. In the wild it was when their partner got sick and went mad, or was harming their young, or was injured and a shitty mate. These days it's a pretty clear sign you went too far.

That is the essense of a Drizo fuckpet... feeling dirty for openly picking being someone else's fuckpet over personal indepence. The longer she's a fuckpet the dirtier she's percieved because no one has a Drizo fuckpet that doesn't intend to constantly use them. The price of fantastically devoted fuckpets is the same as any other pet, they need constant stimulation.

Of course all of this means Drizo-Humio pairs are increadibgly common and everyone has their version of a dirty D-H fantasy.

Candi was SUCH a fucking slut. The double shot of so many strangers all bonded together by the pure, ancient, urge to hunt and take her, combined with the first signs of her well-paid shift towards a Huzar-biped sexual ideal starting to swell her breasts and incrase the number of nerve endings and to pair them in a gradient to her sex drive... had her utterly writhing and moaning. As badly as she wanted to pull her Huz practice-cock from it's increaly close resting spot and plunge it with rough declarion and intent into her 100%, unmodified Drio cunt, the cunt that she'd never thought much beyond getting it filled with intent, the cunt that was, according to her last play, the most amazing, fuckable, sexy, cunt he'd ever seen, fucked, filled or fantasized about, the cunt he'd said was as close to a sex drug as he'd ever seen.

That first tingle of bonding, with a Huzn of all species, and his words about her cunt, had being doing laps in her mind for the last 5 months, from probably the moment they'd parted. She'd been so distracted she hadn't played since, to the point her Aunt Crish asked if everything was okay. For a Drizo not to play a few times a week, even just with friends or at a party, was usualy a sign of sickness.

Everyone knew the rumors about the Diplotatic Core, the loose grouping of dependable people that were cool being constantly terrifed of starting an eons long quibble. It had happened before. I was a lot of paperwork. Unlike most completely unfounded rumors about a large yet shadowy group of people that made decisions that impacted your life, and worked in a world they rarely thought about.

After a few poorly contextualized mission summeries that made there way without review into the usual public review basically translated as, "things started off shite but once we all started fucking everything evened out. Pass on to Field Prep that the word "fuck" needs to prioritized higher in the inital lexicon. Seriously."

While the Balance took it in stride once the full context came out, it had already stuck as the meta. "Diplomatic Corps... Fuck Them All!" or "DC - Bringing the universe together, one fuck at a time" or "DC -Ask Me about my Job!" (this was a standard sign that one was looking for something impersonal yet rigourus). There  offical motto was only slightly less salacious, "DC - We Like It Stranger". It did give both kids and adults a chuckle though.

Supposedly there were special versions and anyone with one was in DC and basically advertising an easy fuck.

Svernji-Aja was not DC's best agent. That wasn't due to any lack on hiz part but a lack of any way to measure any of them.

short-circut: Drios are really easy to turn into personal sex pets, but maybe that's not so cool because aside from a single cycle of perfect clarity, they're quickly becoming addicated to a drug that can only be replensihed in a sexual state. 

Candy is a young Drios, she's like all her age, sexually playing with her mates and like-minded people. They're all an experience to share with her friends until her most recent. She'd started setting her filter wider, including all sympat species. She'd had some wild times with various haulers, from captains to minds to a stowaway. All delightful. Including her last, a friendly Huz that carried himself in a way that frissed. He was coming off a stretch and wanted "to get all the fuck out of me so I feel like a mind and not a need".

She'd liked the sound of that. It spoke to her culture, to their lift above drive.

He asked to go slow, with a nod to how long it had been, yet it wasn't just the joy of a great fuck that he missed but the apprication of beauty that I can touch. I'm around heavnely bodies that still bring me to awestruck tears yet in the dark that untouchable beauty makes me miss the beauty in connecting.

He spoke poetry, she tilted an ear, "My
