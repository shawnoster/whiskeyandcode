## The Setup

Two undercover agents tasked with monitoring the same subject. She infiltrates by becoming his girlfriend, he by taking the close buddy route.

Routine surveillance is the backdrop for the two to rekindle a common pattern, getting deeply caught up in a game of decadence jealously as he watches her make love to their subject, as she gives herself while staring into the hidden cameras.

Their game goes too long, they grow sloppy and drunk on the fantasy of being caught, their subject grows from easily manipulated backdrop to paranoid partner that trips over their carrer and life destroying secret and suddenly he's propelled into a game for his life without knowing the rules.

The two agents slide into false reports to hide their growing sloppiness, the signs their cover was about to be blown, lack of time spent shoring up their covers. All to push their game farther, chasing the god-like feeling of knowing all, of how her words to the subject were pale mumbers compared to what she'd said just hours before with her partner while they tried to drown out their conscious with cruelty, mocking the monitors while doubling down on that debt.

The subject becomes a name, becomes a personality, the silent vignettes previously "watched" gain meaning, humanity. They are heart-warming, dirty, shockingly mundane, touched with brilliance and hand-wringing frustration. In all, human.

The agents can no longer get by on false reports alone, there is now oversight, budget and they've promised data/results/hard evidence that they don't have, that they waited too long to get.

Her attempts to manipulate the subject get worse and less successful to the point she's painted herself in a corner after multiple long shots and poorly planned lies. Normally she'd be able to suppress it but their senior drops by give them the good news that the surveillance had been funded and extended and happens to watch her get caught in multiple stories, plus notice several wardrobe mistakes.

Senior reads through several lifted documents, puts together a much different picture of their subject.

Agents pick up on enough of Seniors reactions, watching his trail, to seriously fear being uncovered, blame everything on subject. Agents still don't, and never do, see how their actions caused this, the subject never humanizes in their eyes, their highest compliment was how great a subject he'd been at first. Just interesting enough to get some good stories out of but not so crazy they were always on high-alert.

Escalation Protocol

They contemplate running, there is brief but very solid hope that it'll all work out. There are meaningful moments between subject and her but that's quickly tainted. She was channeling her fucking relief to be done with him into her words while he was asking to make a plan together.

She reunites with agent, no focus on subject, this is her story and in her mind she has done the right and good thing and she is now free to fully love him, with pride that she did her job correct. Her obligation is to the job and has in truth lost the ability to connect with anyone not in the same life. Her detachment is shown to be purposeful and required for her job.

Senior starts reading files about her.

She falls because she has gone outside her own internal principles. She she did to subject is what she trained for, the mocking and dehumaization an agents form of gallows humor, the fucking a required stress-reliever and no one's business. 

Her failure was not keeping watch. She'd used a variant of "daddy's last words before he died in the Marines" to tug a marks heartstrings but in was Mr. Elrichstrom in her 4th grade class instructing her and Ellie Gronschract on their duties as classroom captains while he left to take a dump in the good bathroom. It was the first time a "real" adult had put so much, in her mind, responsibility and gave her that adult serious face that she took as "maximum trust". In truth he was soaked with sweat trying not not shit his pants in front of a bunch of 9 year-olds either way, it made an impact.

Her dad was military of course but often abscent and she melded that moment of responsbiltiy with what she imagined her father to do and so just as her father was never there becuase he was doing important work she learned not to emotionally be there in order ot be like her dad, and thus impress him.

All this explained via psych evals Senior is reading. Just as they're about to bug out Senior keys a misc. personal file that contains, to them, the obvious hard evidence that they've been falsifing evidence from the start. Evidence is if you look at the source code you can obviously tell the IP address is one of their fake cover sites. If Senior goes to that link it'll show the unedited video. He doesn't even click on the fake one, it is utterly insignafiganet to him.

They assume the worst

Subject either partners with Senior and they out-manouver crazy agents. Other is Subject seeing agents together and snaps, after weeks of paranoia and feeling of going crazy he grabs a pipe and smashes the agents face in one blow, perfectly obvious that after just one swing of a thick-gauge steel pipe to the partial front of the face this guy was forever fucked. Instead of falling back on her training she screams "leave him alone!" while subject is now the calculated one and smashes her knee with his full strength, and good follow throw, destroying the kneecap beyond repair.

Subject details this, equisitely, with revenge porn all over it, to Senior. Senior just nods and says, "that's a good one, I like its rage and noble grace", and then launches into a story of depraved revenge, says he polished that for years over his first unsolved involving kids. 

He drives him downtown, to a bar, introduces him a woman, sends him to drink, drug and fuck her. When subject resits Senior puts his hand on his shoulder and says "you've just been reminded that our lives include dark corners and sharp obstacles, go remind yourself of human kindness"

"With a hooker?!"

She gives him a massage, talks him down, he discovers she's a licensed therapist, though he assums massage, not psych), and that she's an artist, not a hooker, and she finds certain kinds of broken fuel for her work.

They fuck and fuck, they laugh. She gives him a painting of their morning watching people walk through the park. Laughs and says the feeling of being in love will fade in a few days as he heals, that a pair of her sexy panties would only draw his mind back to her, and as much fun as it was he wasn't ready, which is why she'd taken him on because neither was she.

The painting captures what I liked best about our time together that is unique, it's how you still smiled at the couples, still checked out the spandex asses, you still cared that I might see.

- [ ] Subject finds out truth
- [ ] Subject assumes a bad breakup and sketchy woman, never knows
- [ ] Male agent gets himself killed, she blames subject, goes on run

Approaches

- First of the book you think he's going crazy/high, seeing things
- Middle it feels like a spy thrill, like big things are going to happen
- Last it's all change, the fall of the arrogant and those that step outside their own rules, growth of subject

---

Theme is of paranoia. At first subject is paranoid, and you discover rightfully so. Next couple is paranoid that they've been found out, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy thought it would have come out
Next Senior is the balanced paranoia, does something useful with it
Next subject decides to cut it out of his life while dealing with it
Next agents are as consumed as subject at the start, overreacting to every action until they hang themselves.

She tries to deliever a "if only we hadn't... we'd have gotten away with it.."

Senior laughs, and laughs, and laughs, "did you hear the class? We're hanging everything on this highly complex operation and got the warrents to go forward based on an impassioned plea from a young but passionate agent!"

Agents come out, most give a little smile, few laugh. No Agent, you were never getting away with this, from the first moment. Ever shread of evidence would have been gone over.

But he's innocent! There'd be no trial!

But your sworn testimatony...

Now she laughs, you actually believed that? I have hard proof... 

She's been caught, offically disavoowing her prior statement.
