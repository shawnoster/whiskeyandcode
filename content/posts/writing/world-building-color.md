A tale told of many,

Man hides pain from stranger
Stranger sees private pain

Who used who?
Did the man allow his pain to be witnessed? Was it use if they both got something from it?

This is one of the basic koans of our society... is it use if it benefits both? If admission, acceptance or asking is too painful and so with a brusque denial one shares their deep shame and, having seen in their eyes an understanding, is then allowed to witness, in passing, in motion, in a way that turned the pain from an eternity to a moment. That is the gift of the observer, they free the subject from infinity, as they are now defined by being on either side of a single moment, that moment of being observed.

And this it’s why obssrvation defines existence and time. It’s simple context and reference.

There are a million billion versions, the religion of infinite yet unknowable names

I have no name, I have all names... what am I? I am the infinite.

He ranted with the vibrations energy of a pre-hormone blast-off checklist, “fuck a Stranger’s Pain!!!”

This would be blasphemous if anyone carred. That was one of the pure delights of being a follower of The Stranger, a religion-philosophy that bloomed at the perfect time in history to base a religion around constant self-reflection and one’s relationship to the various players.

Step outside the religion steeping and it’s a classic religious stock made up of a set of rules vague enough to apply any situation and sort of a buffet of ways to scream into the void. 

Instead of God and the Devil there are two people, and I swear to fucking god this is as clear as I can be; one sees another in pain, they inquire if they may provide aid, the other declines, the other witnesses their pain in private.
