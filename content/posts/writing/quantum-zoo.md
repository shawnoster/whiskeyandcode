Stop glaring at me like that and stop wasting energy stoking your self-rightous flames, it's annoying and is stretching an already thread-bare definition of supper to it's limits. 

Give your rage a few breathes to stretch it's legs, same us, especially given the fact that these potatos seem quite indifferent to either of our moods. Stomaches are honest lovers that care for little but their own needs so stop sulking and eat. Open your mouth, ears and eyes and while you clean us out of every scrap of food let's see if we can teach you something.

Stop acting like the last sad song you heard and pull your head out of whatever revenge fantasy you have your head firmly shoved up inside of and try doing something really scary and listen. You're no mystery, your proud badge of not being understood is just a hand-me down fear that you're not special or even able.

I'm about to make you uncomfortable and you haven't learned how to stare yourself in the eye yet so don't look at me and look down at this board and all it's pieces and don't even begin to fuss over what game it is or isn't because all that matters is that everything in life is on one side and you're on the other. 

No, I don't have clouds in my eyes, I know there aren't any pieces but if you can imagine fucking your new friend the last town over then you can sure as shine imagine a few pieces. I'd tell you to imagine today's little... incident... as pieces on the board but we wouldn't even be having this little chat if you could imagine anything more an overwhelming tide against your single, heroic, tragically out-numbered single piece.

Now think on this, if I was reach across this table and slap your slack-jawed face do you think you'd be the same person you are now, you think the person that sat across from me watching with those doe eyes would be the same person that sputtered like a drowning man after my palm left it's mark?

Now while you're fording that thought here's another here comes the real lesson, who would you be after that mark faded? Who would you be then? Not the fly-catcher sitting across from me now, not the short-lived martyr bearing my brand but someone else entirely, most likely someone filled with a heat hotter.

View life how ya like, I'm no preacher, but before you let the iron of your youth cool consider what's around you, what's around us all, and how the life doesn't give a whore's smile about us supposed sinners and that's a blood and bone fact that you can either try and hide from behind Mary's skirts or you can wise up to the fact that if the sun and moon and dirty don't take any notice of you then you're free to weather the storms however you see fit.

Now look at the board again, you still see only a single piece that you've got to play? Cling too tightly to a broken tool and that's all you'll have, same as if you let a mule's reins slip hoping for a stallion. We are legion when we let go of worrying about our legend.

Wait a breath, squint through all the stupid, trust that as impossible as it sounds your contanst scheming and need to fuck will still be there after a few seconds of rational thought. Line up all those past and future versions of yourself 

Whiskey is a poor substitue for patience, and when one runs out so does the other and I'm running low on whiskey so with my last two fingers of patience I'm kindly requesting you to get off that wooden horse you know and join the rest of us clueless scared shitless adults.

Decisions change after you start playing with all your pieces. Think on this while you evesdrop on me entertaining two of the most honest and hardworking women I've had the pleasure of doing business with; when the gambler sweeps a table of all the other player's dreams how upset do you think he is over the lost hands that showed him their tells? How sure are you that he didn't sacrifice a few pawns to pay for that knowledge?

## Conjecture

_"What if time wasn't linear..."_. That's the usual way most stories about quantum entaglement start, followed by a sequentail metaphor which is in turn followed by that same metaphor turned on its side. The problem as I refer to polietly and the blindspot as I whisper in my head is that the big reveal is invariably nothing more than time reveresed. The future echoing into the past which only seems shocking.

The problem is one of sequencing, namely that most people tend to try and impose one.

A few big reveals...

* You are God. Well, You're your God
