A common question amoung the H7-BMG-Orchard cultures is, "so, what are the different factions and any wars going on?". This question is considered rather cute and is answered patiently.

By the time a culture is meets the Flow they're long past inner conflict. Fun fact, it's not due to having to pull together as a single race in order to overcome an overwhelming disaster. I mean, that happens but it's not the most common reason that a previously war-like and combative culture suddenly drops their laser guns and gets on with life.

It's usually because of a printer. A pretty special one but eventually speicla goes on sale for 99.99 and suddenly everyone has a bio-material multi-purpose fabricator, with cheap material refills available at the local recycling center.

The ability to quickly create both food and buliding materials almost anywhere from little color-coded blocks fixes a whole range of problems. True progress of a society is measured in how evenly distrubted wealth is and how easily obtainable items are.

Once everyone has as much as everyone else, and the beneift to having more wealth or power is removed, well, really, what's it all for?

At a certain technilogical level the entire reason for conqueset is gone.

There are your ritual warrior cultures but in a universe filled with beings that melt your entire frame with a poorly timed sneeze you stop challanging everyone to a fight.

Money is hilarious. There is simply no need and no where to spend it and no way to track any kind of exchange and there's no element or substance so highly prized to use as a backing material. Designs are shared freely and usually with hilarious results.

While similiar cultures are the exception instead of the sci-fi promised norm they do exist. Compatable cultures are given a score, the higher the score the more compatible. It's all much more complex than that but, yeah, basically how far on a date you can go.

To keep people from dying, constantly, every culture has a tell. This tell is a quick guide on how to interact with the being sitting across from you. 

Certain species types tend to have different numbers of compatible clutures. Machine-entites rank the highest, though they're less compatible and more able to quickly build adapters that allow them to share data.

Air-breathing bio-species with an indiviual bias, basically humanoids, had their clumps, though there were also a higher number of spiked matches. A spiked match was one where most factors were in a "friendly" tolerance zone, except for one or two indicators that were wildly incompatible.

Common example is the Walissi and Hrr'a. Physically alike enough to trigger sexual attraction, a palette and digestive system so well aligned that reciepe sharing became a common ice breaker and pick up line. 

Similiar birthing process, social norms compatible tothe point of not thinking about it. Basially it was love at first contact.

The currency, the trade of The Flow, was purpose. Once a culture has made it in the door and learns of the vast variety of other intelligent life they often feel lost. This is common. When you can do anything, have anything, go anywhere, well... what do you do with your day? After all the excess what shall you do with that extended life? This is the Purpose. Everyone eventually searches for one, or changes theirs, or joins up with someone with one to see what it's all about.

Purpose has no size or duration. It may be see as many wonderful and strange animals as possible in 7 years. It might be to terraform a comet into a personal lounge. Usually though it fell into a few buckets; exploration, site-seeing, collecting, experiencing, experimenting. It wasn't uncommon for a being to have tried all of them and more. 

Exploration was packing up the truck and heading out to the weird. The dark corners, the unflown, the strange signals.

Site-seeing was traveling the planets to experience the utter alien and new, at various levels of luxury. This was most often a cover for wanting to meet new people and aliens. Also eating, lots an dlots of eating.

Collecting was usually a group Purpose, a race or lazy jaunt to see who could do the most X in timeframe Y, wiht conditions Z. Most groups kept it friendly thought there were some extreme versions that required personal stakes be put up.

Experiencing was the cosmic journey. Wanting to live as the natives do, to experience a new view on life. It was also a great way to chill out for awhile after a particually hard party circuit.

Experimenting was anything around trying new things. New star drives, new nano-techniques, new lifeforms, etc. From the mad scientest to the guy trying to get Doom to run on some alien's handheld.

Sex, I didn't mention it but everyone knows it's coming. Different cultures trying to fuck each other, cultivating various fetishes, offering unlimited fantasies. You want to picture a dark and seedy underworld of strippers and lights but those only exist for roleplay. Without the pressures of desperation there's a lot fewer broken toys, shame, repressed rage or twisted past to turn good people into snakes.

Kalista, or Kali, was a detective of small things. While there were bigger mysteries, grusome cases, bizarre events, those didn't interest Kali. They were all mostly bits of drama to entertain those that were "roughing" it on outpost planets with guns and wranglers. A planet dude ranch where she'd be playing the role of Detecive, not actually being one.

A detective in the flow meant a very specific generality. They fixed data, they found things, they corrected.

Don't let all the flowers and roses fool you, The Flow was pure chaos. It almost had to be to balance so many different cultures.

Talicn felt the ripple at the base of his neck that meant the engines were online. The throat-purr matched that of the ship, a
