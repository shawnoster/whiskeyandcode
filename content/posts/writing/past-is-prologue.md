Here be the writings of a mad man, the reason why being one of very few topics he didn't seem to hold an opinion on. For almost everything else there are critical thought experiments, passionate rebuttals written from a Devil's advocate perspective, charts and graphs seemingly drawn either by a drunk toddler pissed on free whiskey or aliens. Very smart aliens. Drawn with their mind.

## 1 - The Past is Prologue

_The graduation speech_

The minds an interesting beast and I'm reminded of how unpredictable at this very moment as my carefully crafted sense of gravitas has been replaced with a burning need to know how many of you are naked under your gowns and whether it'd personally find it hotter knowing the girl next to me was completely naked vs. purposeful lingerie, matching even.

Don't. I know my kind and that I only have a few seconds to convince you that spontaneous and joyful group nudity isn't the right call, regardless of how fun the mayhem would be. Find me afterwords and give me your answer as well as your reasoning, it's a fun interview question. So save that mischievous gleam in your eye from a better occlusion because I only have an hour and I have some real shit to tell you.

If you were hoping for something moving yet forgettable then, well, forget about it. For the parents, care-givers, partners, penpals and solo students that didn't get shit from anyone, doesn't need shit from anyone, worked harder than anyone I ask you to hold your reactions until I finish.

From here on out there are no more wise shepard's and champions of knowledge and learning.

Your teachers are more than dispensers and assorrs of knowledge, they are surrogute parents, guides, confessions, drill sergeants, task masters, honest mirrors to help you discover your weaknesses and strengths. 

Even the lone wolves that ended up here only because their car is boxed in and someone said there were to be donuts. Or maybe it was donut coupons which honestly would be preferable. Even my donut eating wolves of solotuide were shaped by them.

### Ask

Even before I understood what the phrase, "the past is prolog" meant I liked how it turned history, universally know to be the most horrible, boring, and dull subject to ever inflict on a human directly after lunch into a mysticism-flavoured incation. 

I'd long assumed I understood that phrase and that it's charm mostly from the slight-alliteration side of the family vs. the rather simple (but no less true) idea that those that don't understand the past are doomed to repeat it. When I understood that it wasn't knowing history that was important but it was understanding what had already been tried before and why it had failed. It didn't promise success, just simple advice that if you're going to try something crazy at least try something crazy and new.

For your generation "The past as prolog" has become more than advice, it's a dire warning. Where do you go when you
