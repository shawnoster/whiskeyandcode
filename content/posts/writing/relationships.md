# True Facts

_"Trust is the *most* important thing EVER to a relationship. OMG I love my sweet baboo so much I can tell them anything. I trust them completely!"_

Somewhere there is a saying that a thing untested isn't fully a thing yet, or something like that but wiser and delevered in a semi-mocking tone implying that you'd be a complete idiot to trust anything of worth to something that's never been proven.

The beating heart at the center of a healthy and vital relationship isn't a firey, molten, universe warping star but the faint, almost inaudible slow and steady ticking of a well-cared for precision insturment.

I call your bluff and raise you a demand for proof, which I just happen to have a way to test for.

Measuring trust is easier than most realize, take a person's emotional reaction when shown photos of their trusted partner enthusiastically, and plausibly, fucking another and combine it with the length of time it takes them to consider it's providence.

The more intense and uglier your reaction the less you trust them. Ever stumble onto a picture you've never seen before of your partner, maybe read a comment thread that didn't quite line up with what you know.
