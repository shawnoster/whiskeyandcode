How have you not

What do you mean you don’t know what it is they like big pimples they’re blue ruptured pimples of energy how could you not know that by looking at the model

The universe is not a flat plane it’s a sphere like everything else in the goddamn universe are you a flat universe or you have problems now do you see it it’s just a big sale at outgassing that’s it

And yes you can now start applying all those biological models that were baked into your DNA so you could understand high-level concepts you do the same thing we send out numerical things just someone else trying to do with biology and you are slow

Your code breakers you are the front line engineers you’re the ones that we send in when we want to problem fixed your the swat team is a special ops your whole independent task force

Oh, oh, you’re from an engineering corp society.

You mean warrior-engineer

No, I meantvwgg F at I said, I may have your idioms off by 1 but I know what I’m saying.

But...
Nooope, sorry, nope-tram coming through. As surprising as it is, warrior castes union up real fast. It’s either that or die real early. It requires a rather keen intelligence to overcome that natural desire for combat.

Warrior castes reach the stars fairly quickly as well. Most go mercenary, battle consultants, diplomats. Don’t laugh meat puff, violence is done best by then, not only.

Ritual combat is a common part of negotiations. It’s sort of funny, you see it didn’t really exist until some comics and a few action flicks romanizing star-crossed warriors from different clans (and species!) there was one scene where they battle as a way to save their nations, at the cost of risking their very lives

They play tested the ending where both die to save their people. That theatre no longer exists. Seems the actual species wondered what all the fuss was about.

So now to show how bored with reality they were theyed demand a ritual combat segment. Usually followed by them fucking. While the delegation watched.

This isn’t at all accurate but it’ll work, if someone offered to pay you to hang out with your friends and other fun people, all expenses paid, with cool toys. And like all summer camps you’ll probably do lots of innocent and naughty flirting. All that’s yours if you’ll have a sword fight with wrapping paper tubes.

Combat is sexy summer camp to these beings. Fucking in front of everyone is goofy, lacks the intensity of real combat but is sorta fun. Their intimacy rites seem bizarre to us. 

They understand your obsession with sex and indulge it much how humans can’t help petting a Drshans tail if offered. Even though they know it’s basically a depraved sex act for them all they think is “pretty kitty”.

It’s not uncommon for a warrior to shade or trade sex for, basically whatever. You’ll see some species more than others. While they all think humans fascination is hilarious there’s a difference between being watched while you wash your hands vs while you take a piss.

Compatibility between species is also a thing. 

Welcome, I’m your guide.

Engineering... oh, oh I see, yup tragic every time. You are code breakers, problem solvers. High burn rate, best used on underdeveloped worlds.

You
