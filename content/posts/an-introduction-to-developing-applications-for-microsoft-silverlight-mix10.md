A quick heads up for anyone that saw my upcoming talk at MIX10. I'm super excited (why do normal excited when you can be *super* excited!) to show everyone the basics of Silverlight so people can begin creating rockstar web and Windows Phone applications. Speaking of the basics I want to share for anyone that did a Bing search wondering who this Shawn Oster fellow is and what his talk is really about.

My talk, [An Introduction to Developing Applications for Microsoft Silverlight](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/CL15), really is an introduction, a 101. Maybe you are a HTML/JavaScript ninja, perhaps you're just starting out, maybe you decided hand tuning assembly had lost its luster, whatever reason if you're a blank Silverlight slate then this is the talk for you. On the other hand if you know about this crazy concept called XAML or have the basics of wiring up event handlers and doing a little data binding then this talk is definitely not for you.

If you're hoping for some Windows Phone love then you don't have to wait too much longer, Mike Harsh and Peter Torr lay down all the Windows Phone specific goods for you in the talks following mine. Think of my talk as a primer for those that need a quick intro to some of the concepts they'll be seeing later.

MIX is an awesome, information-packed developer/designer lovefest and I'd hate for you to miss out on another track having to sit through 101 information.
