# Hello, I'm Shawn Oster

This is my **personal** blog, all views expressed are mine, without concern or influen ce from any outside party. Basically everything I say is who I am, not my employer, so life-life con artists can fuck off.

## History

I've been writing code since 1983. I still love it.
